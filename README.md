Turtle Games is a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. The company manufactures and sells its own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Turtle Games has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by utilising customer trends.  

To improve overall sales performance, Turtle Games has an initial set of questions to understand their customer demographic and sales trends. Turtle Games wants to understand: 

how customers accumulate loyalty points
how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments 
how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns
the impact that each product has on sales
how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)
what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales.
